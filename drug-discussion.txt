Task 2 : part 8 
Only the MLP and top MLP will change in value; because the technique use randomization to discover a suitable set of weights for the specific mapping function from inputs to outputs in the data being learnt. 
It implies that each time the training algorithm is run, the unique network on the specific training data will fit a new network with a different model skill.
